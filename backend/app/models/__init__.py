# Models package
# Import all models here so they're registered with SQLAlchemy

# Example model (delete when you create your actual models)
from .example import ExampleModel

# When you add real models, import them here:
# from .user import User
# from .post import Post

# Make sure to import all models so Alembic can detect them
