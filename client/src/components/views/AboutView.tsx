            "To illustrate the issue, I describe such insights, and give an
            example concrete algorithm of a day-dreaming loop (DDL): a
            background process that continuously samples pairs of concepts from
            memory. A generator model explores non-obvious links between them,
            and a critic model filters the results for genuinely valuable ideas.
            These discoveries are fed back into the system's memory, creating a
            compounding feedback loop where new ideas themselves become seeds
            for future combinations."

          This site implements a rudimentary system in the spirit of Gwern's DDL
          algorithm. A new dream is initiated with two randomly generated
          concepts that an LLM combines to create a third concept. The user can
          then continue the dream by generating a new concept created from two
          randomly selected concepts that were previously generated in the
          dream.
