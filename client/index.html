      content="Daydream is inspired by the Gwern.net essay LLM Daydreaming, where he introduces the concept of an AI system that continuously combines concepts to generate novel insights and ideas. 
This site implements a rudimentary system in the spirit of Gwern's DDL algorithm. A new dream is initiated with two randomly generated concepts that an LLM combines to create a third concept. The user can then continue the dream by generating a new concept created from two randomly selected concepts that were previously generated in the dream.

This was built on a Saturday afternoon in August of 2025 using the 8090 Software Factory."
